# dmc
Idiomatic platform layer in the likes of the SDL2 or SFML.  
DMC used to stand for "DirectMedia Crate", but I'd rather have it mean "Display & Media Crate" or something.

## State
This is an obvious work-in-progress.  
It's being developed alongside some of my projects for this year, as the needs arise.
